# Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration repository! 
This repo contains my personal setup and configuration for Neovim.

## Features

- **Plugin Management**: Easy installation and management of plugins using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).

- **Customization**: Configurations for various languages and file types, tailored to my preferences.
